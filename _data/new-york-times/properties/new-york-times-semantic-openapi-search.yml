  title: Semantic API
  description: >
    The Semantic API complements the Articles API. With the Semantic API, you
    get access to the long list of people, places, organizations and other
    locations, entities and descriptors that make up the controlled vocabulary
    used as metadata by The New York Times (sometimes referred to as Times Tags
    and used for Times Topics pages.


    **Note:** In URI examples and field names, *italics* indicate placeholders
    for

    variables or values. Parentheses ( ) indicate optional items. Square
    brackets [ ] are not a convention â€” when URIs include brackets, interpret
    them literally.


    **The Semantic API at a Glance**


    **Base URI**

    organizations and descriptors used to classify New York Times articles
    metadata) and New York Times articles from 1981 to today (excludes wire
    services such as the Associated Press)

    ### KEY CONCEPTS



    The first and simplest way to access the API is to refer to a concept is by
    type. There are seven concept types: people, places, organizations,
    descriptors, creative work titles, topics, and public companies. The
    concept\_type is a mandatory parameter for accessing the Semantic API with a
    concept type request.


    Examples of specific concepts, and their associated concept\_type:  



    | **Concept Type** | **concept\_type** | **specific\_concept\_name**      |

    |------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|

    | Descriptor       | nytd\_des         | Absenteeism                      |

    | Location         | nytd\_geo         | Acapulco (Mexico)                |

    | Organization     | nytd\_org         | 3M Company                       |

    | Person           | nytd\_per         | Abbas, Mahmoud                   |

    | Public Company   | nytd\_porg        | |

    | Title            | nytd\_ttl         | The Joy of Painting (TV Program) |

    | Topic            | nytd\_topic       | |



    If you wish to determine which articles are associated with a particular

    concept, you can use the article search API and specify the concept in the
    fq parameter.


    | **Concept Type** | **specific\_concept\_name**      | **Search API
    Query**                                |

    |------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

    | Descriptor       | Absenteeism                      |
    subject:absenteeism                                 |

    | Location         | Acapulco (Mexico)                | glocations:
    "Acapulco (Mexico)"                     |

    | Organization     | 3M Company                       | organizations: "3M
    Company"                         |

    | Person           | Abbas, Mahmoud                   | persons: "Abbas,
    Mahmoud"                           |

    | Title            | The Joy of Painting (TV Program) | creative\_works:
    "The Joy of Painting (TV Program)" |


    If you are not sure the name and type of the concept that you are looking
    for, you can use the search endpoint of the semantic API to find concepts by
    substring.


    In addition to the mandatory parameters corresponding to the three ways of
    accessing the Semantic API, optional parameters can also be applied. The
    "fields" parameter can be given the value "all" to provide a global request
    that

    includes all optional parameters.


    Requests

    --------


    This section summarizes Semantic Search request URIs and parameters. For
    best results, first review Key Concepts, then come back here to start
    building your request URI.


    ### URI STRUCTURE


    Semantic concept requests use the following URI structure:


    -   **Name**: For concept type and specific concept requests:


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/<concept_type>/<specific_concept>.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key

    ```



    -   **Search**: For searching the complete list of concepts:


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key

    ```

     

    ###  


    Constructing a Semantic API Request by Concept Type and Specific Concept

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


    concept\_type is one of seven types:


    1.  *nytd\_geo* for a location


    2.  *nytd\_per* for a person


    3.  *nytd\_org* for an organization


    4.  *nytd\_des* for a descriptor


    5.  *nytd\_ttl* for a creative work title


    6.  *nytd\_topic* for a topic


    7.  *nytd\_porg* for a public company


    specific\_concept\_name is a term in The New York Times controlled
    vocabulary.


    The general form for a Semantic API request by concept type and specific
    concept:


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/<concept_type>/<specific_concept_name>.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key

    ```


    Examples of Semantic API requests by concept type and specific concept:


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_des/Baseball.json?fields=all&api-key=your-API-key


    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_per/Obama,
    Barack.json?fields=pages,links,scope_notes&api-key=your-API-key (you need
    the space after the comma separating last name and first name)

    ```
     
     
    Constructing a Semantic API Search Query

    ---------------------------


    The general form for Search Query consists of a query string

    (*query=*query\_term) and optional parameters.


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json?query=<query_term>(&optional_parameters)&api-key=your-api-key

    ```


    The optional parameters for a Search Query are *concept\_type*,

    *concept\_uri*, *article\_uri*. These optional parameters are derived from

    the other types of Semantic API requests and are explained in the
    instructions for constructing those requests (above).


    An example of a Search Query, it asks for all of the concepts of type

    'nytd\_per' that contain the substring "Evan" and return the result
    formatted in

    JSON.


    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json?query=evan&concept_type=nytd_per&api-key=your-api-key

    ```

     
    -


    Examples

    --------


    These examples do not include the required `api-key` parameter. Be sure to

    include your API key in your request.


    ### REQUESTS & RESPONSES


    **Request**


    -   **Name**: Requests all fields for the concept with concept\_type
        ='nytd\_geo' and concept\_name='Kansas'.  

    ```

    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_geo/Kansas?fields=all&api-key=your-API-key

    ```


    **Response**
